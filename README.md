# WonderBot

An AI powered study guide creation app powered by the Perplexity API. 

WonderBot is a generative robot that can help users create a learning guide.
Nowadays, some people, especially students, find it difficult to learn systematically 
and informatively through the Internet. What Wonderbot aims to implement is 
generating a "learning guide" in PDF format that includes a step-by-step leading 
process, intended to help users start learning more quickly and easily.

We used the Perplexity API as a search and generation medium. The results are condensed
into a PDF, which contains all the questions and reading resources that a beginner needs.
The icons and interface are user friendly.
