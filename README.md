# WonderBot

An AI powered study guide creation app powered by the Perplexity API. 

WonderBot is a generative robot that can help users create a learning guide.
Nowadays, some people, especially students, find it difficult to learn systematically 
and informatively through the Internet. What Wonderbot aims to implement is 
generating a "learning guide" in PDF format that includes a step-by-step leading 
process, intended to help users start learning more quickly and easily.

We used the Perplexity API as a search and generation medium. The results are condensed
into a PDF, which contains all the questions and reading resources that a beginner needs.
All materials used are based from academic sources, providing high quality materials.
The icons and interface are user friendly.

WonderBot generated PDFs are available to everyone to view and download, as all generated PDFs
are accessible via the "List" page. This means that one may find previously generated resources,
which saves them time and effort. 

An easy form is displayed on the "Create" page, where the user enters a topic prompt, number of exercises,
and grade level. Perplexity is used to break the topic prompt into the main topic as well as many subtopics.
